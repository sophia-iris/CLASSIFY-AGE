# CLASSIFY-AGE

I used thonny, a Phyton IDE. 

## How It Works 
- This program allows you to categorized a person based on their age.
- The function called classify_age will take age as in put and classify individuals as: Child (0-12 years), Teen (13-19 years), Adult (20-64 years), and Senior (65+ years).
- If an invalid age (negative number) is entered, it would print Invalid age! Age cannot be negative.

## How to Run the program
Open Thonny.
Run the file using the CLASSIFY-AGE code.
